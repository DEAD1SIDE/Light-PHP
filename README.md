# Light-PHP

### Documentation
[Light-PHP documentation](https://bakeiro.github.io/Light-PHP-documentation/)   

Micro PHP framework :)

Light-PHP makes possible start working without reading in massive documentations of professional frameworks, if this is the case, then Light-PHP might be very useful for you. Light-PHP is easy to install, and doesn't make things more complicated than necessary.

It offers a MVC structure, micro template engine, database abstraction, session management, debug console (for PHP) and more!.
This was created to be the most simple framework to read/understand, so you can use it for learning or use it in your projects if you wish.

### Disclaimer
- This was made 100% by me as a personal project (basically to prove myself).
- This might not be 100% secure, use at your own risk!, any feedback about security or structure is welcome ;)
- This framework comes with a sample site, this site doesn't pretend to be complete (don't expect register forms, remember me checkbox or other features), it's just a sample of how you can use this framework.

### Minimum requirements
- PHP OpenSSL extension (if wants session encryption, something recommended)
- Web Server (Apache suggested)
- PHP (at least 5.4)
- Database (MySQLi suggested)

### Install
- Import database.sql
- Edit system/config/config_data.php file to set up the database name and folders paths
- Start web server and database server
